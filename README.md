## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher installed
- Maven installed
- MySQL database running

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/hirwachretien/e-commerce-simpleapplication.git
   cd e-commerce-simpleapplication
   

2. **Configure the database**

   Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your MySQL credentials:
   ```
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommercedb
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=hirwa2002
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   

3. **Add product images (optional)**

   Place your product images in:
   
   src/main/resources/static/images/
   
   Reference them in your product entities as `/images/yourimage.jpg`.

4. **Build and Run**
   bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080/` (or your configured port).

### Default Roles & Logins

By default, you should configure at least one admin user in the database.  
If you have a data.sql or initial migration, update as needed.

## Usage

- **User:** Browse `/products`, add to cart, checkout, see `/user-dashboard` and `/orders`.
- **Admin:** Access `/admin-dashboard` for management, `/admin/orders` for all orders, `/admin/reports` for reports, `/admin/customers` for customer list.
